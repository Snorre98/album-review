## Review album (us-1)

As a fan of music, I would like an app where I could review my favorite albums and look up my previous reviews, so I never forget the albums I loved listening to. I would also like the opportunity to delete a review if I made a mistake or have no need for it anymore.

The user has a need to rate, review and remember the albums they have listened to, while being able to remove a review if it is no longer something they have need for anymore. 

### Important to be able to see:
-	List of previous album reviews 

### Important to be able to do:
-	Review albums with:
    -   Name 
    -   Rating
-	Add review to list of reviews
-	Delete reviews

## Album-Review (us-2)
Now when I have an app where I can review and save my favourite albums I would love to be able to see other peoples reviews. My wish now is to see what other people think about my favourite albums, while also seeing new albums for new music recommendations! 

The user now wants more functionality on the app, as he wants the app to have multiple users, and to be able to see what other people think about different music!  

### Important to be able to see:
- Login/signup page
- List of albums (albums view. Information: title and artist) 
- List of reviews within each album view, both reviews I have added and reviews other users have added.

## Important to be able to do:
- Create username
- Add an album
- Click on album added
- Add review to album, tied to username
- Delete review to album (if logged in as user that created it)
