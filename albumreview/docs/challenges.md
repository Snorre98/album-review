# Challenges in our project
The "restserver" package in the SpringBoot module has the wrong name (RESTserver) in the master branch in GitLab. Rename the package folder to "restserver" to fix this. We tried to fix this, but either Git or GitLab is handelig folder-names weird.

## Challenge 1

### Description of challenges

The first issue was that the REST API was finished late in the project, because the team members responsible for writing the API had a hard time understanding how it should be structured in the project. 

The second issue was that we should have made sure more team-members worked on the API so that a larger part of the team had an understanding of the API. 

The third issue was poor planning of how the REST API could affect other parts of the code-base. 

### Strategies

We tried to get an understanding of REST API, but the sources we used (like the todo-list example) and the SpringBoot documentation was confusing at first. In the end we understood how to make a simple REST API using basic SpringBoot tools.

We have tried to do good planning during the entire project, but because we understood the REST API technology late it was hard to plan for how this would affect the codebase. 

### Reflection

We believe we would have been able to finish the app with the use of the API if the API had been finished a week earlier. So this challenge comes down to poor planning and the fact that more team members should have been working on the API to get familiar with the technology.
