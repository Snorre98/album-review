# Album-Review (us-2)
Now when I have an app where I can review and save my favourite albums I would love to be able to see other peoples reviews. My wish now is to see what other people think about my favourite albums, while also seeing new albums for new music recommendations! 

The user now wants more functionality on the app, as he wants the app to have multiple users, and to be able to see what other people think about different music!  

## Important to be able to see:
- Login/signup page
- List of albums (albums view. Information: title and artist) 
- List of reviews within each album view, both reviews I have added and reviews other users have added.

## Important to be able to do:
- Create username
- Add an album
- Click on album added
- Add review to album, tied to username
- Delete review to album (if logged in as user that created it)
